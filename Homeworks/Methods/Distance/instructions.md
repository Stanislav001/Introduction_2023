Given the Length and Speed of the train and the time takes by the train to passes the bridge or tunnel, the task is to find the length of the bridge.
Examples: 
 

Input : length of train = 120 meters, Speed = 30 m/sec, time = 18 sec 
Output : length of bridge = 420 meters.
Input : length of train = 130 meters, Speed = 25 m/sec, time = 21 sec 
Output : length of bridge = 395 meters.
